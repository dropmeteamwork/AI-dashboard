# AI Engineer Dashboard

## Introduction

The AI Engineer Dashboard is a comprehensive web-based interface designed to empower AI engineers with the tools necessary to monitor, manage, and optimize the performance of Recycling Vending Machines (RVMs) equipped with AI capture capabilities. This dashboard provides a centralized platform for critical operations, including manual selection for flagged items, AI version updates, and real-time machine monitoring, all presented through an intuitive and visually appealing graphical user interface.

## Features Overview

At its heart, the dashboard addresses three primary operational needs for AI engineers:

*   **Manual Selection for Flagged Items:** The system automatically flags images of recyclable items where the AI model's confidence in classification is low. The dashboard provides a dedicated interface for AI engineers to manually review these flagged items, confirm or correct classifications, and add custom tags. This human-in-the-loop feedback is crucial for continuous model improvement and error resolution.

*   **AI Version Update:** As AI models evolve and improve, the dashboard facilitates the seamless deployment of new AI versions to the RVM units. This includes functionalities for uploading new models, viewing version history, comparing performance across different versions, and initiating rollbacks if necessary. This ensures that RVMs are always running with the most accurate and efficient AI models.

*   **Real-time Monitoring for Machines:** The dashboard offers real-time insights into the operational status and performance of individual RVM units. Engineers can monitor machine uptime, processing rates, average AI confidence scores, and connectivity status. This immediate visibility allows for proactive identification and resolution of issues, minimizing downtime and maximizing efficiency.

### Dashboard Sections and Capabilities

The dashboard is organized into several key sections, each providing specific functionalities:

*   **Overview Tab:** This serves as the landing page, offering a high-level summary of the RVM network's health and performance. It includes key statistics cards (e.g., total items processed, average confidence, flagged items count, active machines), a feed of recent activities and alerts, and a real-time processing metrics chart. This section provides a quick snapshot for engineers to assess the overall system status.

*   **Machines Tab:** This section provides detailed monitoring of individual RVM units. Each machine is represented by a card displaying its current status (online/offline), last activity timestamp, items processed, and average AI confidence. Engineers can also access quick actions like viewing specific machine captures or initiating a manual sync.

*   **Flagged Items Tab:** This is the primary interface for manual review and correction of AI classifications. It presents flagged images in a grid layout, allowing engineers to view classification details, confidence scores, and timestamps. Crucially, it provides buttons to mark classifications as 'Correct' or 'Incorrect' and to add custom tags (e.g., "blurred", "unusual", "damaged"). Search and filter functionalities are available to streamline the review process, and engineers can export flagged items for further analysis or model retraining.

*   **AI Models Tab:** This section is dedicated to the management of AI models. It displays the current active model version, its deployment date, and overall accuracy. Engineers can upload new model versions, compare their performance against existing ones, and initiate rollbacks to previous stable versions if needed. This ensures robust version control and easy deployment of improved AI capabilities.

*   **Analytics Tab:** This powerful section provides deep insights into the RVM network's performance through various data visualizations. It includes charts such as processing trends (items processed over time), classification distribution (breakdown by item type), machine performance comparisons, and error trends (flagged vs. resolved items). Additionally, it offers a confidence score distribution chart and system health metrics, providing a holistic view of the system's operational efficiency and AI model accuracy.
